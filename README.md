This Portfolio was created by Lara Remmelberger and Marlon Schiedeck.



Technology used for this project:

(html, p5.js)

In order to be able to display the portfolio like a website, we decided to work with html and p5.js, which is an open source library for java script that resembles processing (a programming language mainly used for creating visual art).



Algorithm: 

The drawFractal functions are responsible for drawing fractal patterns on the respective graphics layers, so that they appear in the background. These fractals are created using a recursive approach, where each function calls itself to draw smaller segments of the fractal.
The fractal is divided into n segments a loop runs n times to create n segments 

This creates complex patterns by dividing each segment into smaller segments, and n controls the number of segments at each level of recursion, thus affecting the complexity and appearance of the fractal



End result: 

Our end result is a website with a canvas which can be used to create endless amounts of outputs of a collage like artpiece. 
Those eldless amounts of different artpieces are achieved by a certain degree of randomness in our code, but mostly by user interactivity.
The users can draw rectangles in different sizes and positions, plant a flexible amount of trees on the canvas and change the background structure by putting in numbers on the top left of the canvas. Ultimately the user can try out different compositions and structures and generate an infinite amount of different art pieces.
We have combined mathematical geometric structures with organic ones which contrast in bright neon colors. 
Red and blue rectangles are drawn on the canvas and trees with a colorful shading can be planted.
